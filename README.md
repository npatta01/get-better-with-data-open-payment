# About 
Our repo for the [getting better with data Hackathon](http://getbetterwithdata.com/) held on November 6 -7 

Our team was assigned to look at the [CMS Open Payment](https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Explore-the-Data/Dataset-Downloads.html) data.


# Data

Sometimes, doctors and hospitals have financial relationships with health care manufacturing companies. These relationships can include money for research activities, gifts, speaking fees, meals, or travel. The Affordable Care Act requires CMS to collect information from applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in order to report information about their financial relationships with physicians and hospitals. 

Open Payments is the federally run program that collects the information about these financial relationships and makes it available to you. View the summary data dashboard for an overview of the published data.

# Analysis
Due to the size of the data, we limited our analysis on the top 4 payed specialities in the dataset.

We looked at
- the distribution of payment amounts
- the reported reason of payments
- payment distribution by state
- specialities with the most investments
- Mapped where the payments are being made
